John Bede Polding OSB was born 18th October 1794 at Liverpool, England. He died 16th March 1877 in Darlinghurst, Sydney. Aged 83 years.

Polding was a member of the Benedictine Order and was ordained a Benedictine priest in 1819. He fulfilled many positions such as parish priest, prefect, novice master and sub-prior in his monestary. He was consecrated Bishop in London on the 29th June 1834 for the new vicariate which, besides New South Wales, included the rest of New Holland and Van Dieman's Land.

Bishop Polding reached Sydney in September 1835. For many years, he worked like one of his priests, saying Mass daily in various stations, often in the convict prisons, teaching the Catechism, hearing the confessions of multitudes, and attending the sick and dying. He obtained permission to give retreats in the prison establishments, and between 1836 and 1841 no less than 7000 convicts made at least ten days' retreat under his guidance. He established refuges for women and abandoned children.

In 1842 Polding was elevated to the position of first Catholic Archbishop of Sydney and primate of Australia. Polding was instrumental in securing more priests, brothers and nuns for Sydney. He founded the University College of St John at Sydney and the College of St Mary at Lyndhurst. He founded the first Australian congregation, the Sisters of the Good Samaritan of the Order of St Benedict in Sydney in 1857 and was responsible for establishing Melbourne as a separate diocese.His hard work and unbounded zeal earned him respect from both Catholics and Protestants. Apart from the many churches he founded, Polding began the construction of the second St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney in 1868.<br /><br />

Father James Dixon was born in Castlebridge, County Wexford in 1758. He died on the 4th January 1840 and is buried in his parish chapel at Crossabeg, County Wexford. Aged 82 years.

Father James Dixon, 'the convict priest', was ordained a priest in 1784. Fr Dixon returned to the Diocese of Ferns in 1785 and having assisted in various parishes was appointed to Crossabeg in 1794 to assist Fr Redmond Roche, Parish Priest. In May 1798 Fr Dixon was denounced to the Authorities as "a United Irishman" and he was arrested on the 26th May 1798, summarily tried, convicted and sentenced to transportation, being sent to Duncannon Fort to await transport to Botany Bay.

Following the suppression of the rebellion Fr Dixon was retried but again found guilty and in September 1799 was transported aboard the "Friendship" arriving in Botany Bay on January 16th 1800. Fr Dixon was allowed to remain in Port Jackson (now Sydney) and in 1802 was accorded leave to "afford Spiritual consolation to the Catholic convicts". He celebrated the first public Mass on Australian soil on 15th May 1803 at Port Jackson, followed by Mass at Parramatta on 22nd May 1803 and at Hawkesbury on 29th May 1803. In 1804 Pope Pius VII appointed Fr Dixon as 'Prefect Apostolic' of New Holland (now Australia) and thus Fr Dixon became the founding father of Australian Catholicism and also the first formal Ecclesiastical appointment by the Holy See to Australia. 1804 saw an Irish convicts uprising and Governor King believed attendance at Mass provided a meeting place for sedition. Consequently, convicts were forced to attend Anglican services. Fr Dixon though, continued to practise, baptising and marrying. In the 1806 muster he was described as 'Roman Catholic Priest, self-employed'. Protestants and Catholics supported his stay in the colony. In 1808 he obtained permission to return to Ireland and to work at Crossabeg, where he became parish priest in 1819 remaining until his death in 1840. <br /><br />

St Mary MacKillop was born on the 15th January 1842 in Fitzroy, Melbourne. She died on the 8th August, 1909 in North Sydney. She was canonised by Pope Benedict XVI in Rome on the 17th October, 2010 under the name St Mary of the Cross. Aged 67 years.

Mary Ellen MacKillop was the eldest of seven children to Alexander MacKillop and Flora MacDonald. Mary started work at the age of fourteen as a clerk in Melbourne and later as a teacher in Portland. To provide for her needy family Mary took up a job as governess in 1860 at her Aunt and Uncle's place at Penola in South Australia where she would look after them and educate them. Already set on helping the poor, Mary included other children on the estate. Her work introduced her to Father Julian Tenison Woods. Woods was concerned about the lack of Catholic education in South Australia. In 1867 Fr Woods with Mary as the first sister and Mother Superior were co-founders of the Congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus - Josephites. Dedicated to the education of the children of the poor, regardless of religious denomination, it was the first religious congregation to be founded by an Australian. The Sisters were involved with orphanages, neglected children, girls in danger, the aged poor, a reformatory, a home for the aged and incurably ill. The Sisters were prepared to follow farmers, railway workers and miners into the isolated outback and live as they lived. They shared the same hardships while educating their children.

In 1871 Mary was wrongly excommunicated by Bishop Sheil who in 1872 before his death lifted the excommunication order. By 1877 the Sisters operated forty schools in Adelaide, Queensland and New South Wales. In 1883 the Sisters were in New Zealand and by 1889 were in Victoria. In 1902 Mary suffered a stroke paralysing her right side. Pope John Paul II beatified Mary on 19th January 1995.

St Mary of the Cross MacKillop is Australia's first saint. "Never see a need without doing something about it." (1867) <br /><br />
